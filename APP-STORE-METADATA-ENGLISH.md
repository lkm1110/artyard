## 📞 Questions?

If Apple asks about marketplace features:
> "We're building ArtYard in phases. Version 1.0 establishes our community and allows artists to build their following. Marketplace features will be added in version 1.1 once our payment integration is complete."

This is a completely acceptable and common approach! 👍
